# Word Learning App ðŸ“š

This is a Kotlin application designed to help users learn new words effectively, with smart reminders and personalized progress tracking.

## Features 

- **Comprehensive Dictionary**: For now the app includes a selection of around 500 words, pulled from a dictionary licensed from Wikipedia.
- **Synonyms and Derivatives**: Each word entry includes examples, synonyms and derivatives, helping users understand words in context.
- **Customizable Learning**: Users can select specific definitions they want to focus on, tailoring the learning experience to their needs.
- **Adaptive Reminders**: While notifications are not yet implemented, the app still adapts to the user's learning speed. Words that are mastered quickly are shown less frequently, reinforcing learning retention.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app intelligently adapts to your progress. Words you learn faster appear less frequently, helping to optimize review sessions.
